001: pulseaudio crashes after several days of use.
    Status: open
    tasks:
    - try to replicate on another Pi system?
    - raspian lite does not install pulseaudio or pipewire by default.  It is needed for GUI desktop versions.
      
002: tornado library has memory leak.
    status: open
    tasks:
    -  wait for Ben to resolve.
    -  use workaround with version 4.5.3 of tornado.  Must compile from source and fix two source bugs.
    -  figure out how to use bridge code under venv with a systemctl service.  Call /home/greg/sos/.sos_venv/bin/python3 from anywhere.
    
    
003: ZMQ bridge connects only to open ZMQ publisher.  Should poll to see when publisher starts.
    status: closed
    tasks:
    - add code to poll for valid ZMQ host on localhost.
    - could not replicate issue with ZMQ version 4.3.5.

    status: open
    tasks:
    - add charts to html code.
    - add chart generation to service script.
    
005:  Get tornado to serve static files including index.html.  This avoids needing apache.
    status: done
    - used python built-in module to serve simple pages:  sudo python3 -m http.server 80 --directory sos_dash/dist/
    
006:  ufw install stops for asking if update is ok.
        status: done
        - fixed with --force option
